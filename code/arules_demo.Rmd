```

## The Basics

Let's walk through a brief demo of mining association rules in R. We will rely on the `arules` package, though there are other complementary packages out there, particularly `arulesViz`. Check it out if you're interested. 

Note, sometimes association rule mining is called "market basket analysis." So out of respect for this, we will practice by mining some grocery data. But for your challenge, you will mine a large social science survey from the CDC. 

First, load the data and read as transaction data.

```{r echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
library(arules)

groceries <- read.transactions("../data/groceries.csv", sep = ",")

groceries <- read.transactions(file.choose(), sep = ",")
```

Inspect the basics of the data in a few ways...

```{r echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
summary(groceries)
```

```{r echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
inspect(groceries[1:5])
```

```{r echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
itemFrequency(groceries[ , 1:5])
```

Of note, `arules` relies on base R to plot, so the same commands apply, like margins, title, labs, etc.

```{r echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
itemFrequencyPlot(groceries, support = 0.1)

itemFrequencyPlot(groceries, topN = 20)
```

For the following line, count the items for row 1 and corroborate with the previous display of the first to show blocks == items in a transaction.

```{r echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
image(groceries[1:5])
```

```{r echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
image(sample(groceries, 100))
```

## The Apriori Algorithm

Let's start with a basic implementation of `apriori()` to mine these data. 

```{r echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
g_rules <- apriori(groceries, 
                   parameter = list(support = 0.006, 
                                    confidence = 0.25, 
                                    minlen = 2)); summary(g_rules)
```

```{r echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
inspect(g_rules[1:3])
```

```{r echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
inspect(sort(g_rules, by = "lift")[1:5])
```

What is "pip fruit"? We can inspect in a more targeted way via `%in%`.

```{r echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)

pip_rules <- subset(g_rules, 
                    items %in% "pip fruit"); inspect(sort(pip_rules, 
                                                          by = "confidence"))
```

We can also write the results of our mining effort as a data frame via `as()`. Note, at last check, the function doesn't yet support tibbles.

```{r echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
g_rules_df <- as(g_rules, "data.frame")
```

Take a look...

```{r echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
glimpse(g_rules_df)

# or

g_rules_df %>% 
  str()
```
